SEO (search engine optimization) is a set of processes aimed at improving a website’s visibility in search engines, like Google, with the goal of getting more organic traffic. SEO is about fulfilling users’ search needs by creating relevant, high-quality content and providing
 the best possible user experience
 These algorithms take into account a huge number of ranking factors to decide where a specific page should rank.

 Search engines recommend SEO efforts that benefit both the user search experience and page’s ranking, by featuring content that fulfills user
  search needs. This includes the use of relevant keywords in titles, meta descriptions, and headlines (H1), featuring descriptive URLs with 
  keywords rather than strings of numbers, and schema markup to specify the page's content
  meaning, among other SEO best practices.
